 * This class provides an implementation of the 
 * {@link org.jocean.j2se.jdmk.comm.RemoteMBeanServer RemoteMBeanServer}
 * interface based on the HTTP/SSL protocol.
 * <P>
 * Querying a Java Dynamic Management agent with this connector implies
 * that an instance of
 * {@link org.jocean.j2se.jdmk.comm.HttpsConnectorServer HttpsConnectorServer}
 * is running on the remote Java Dynamic Management agent.
 * <P>
 * <strong>Note - </strong> Use the {@link #connect connect} method to identify
 * the Java Dynamic Management agent with which the connector must communicate.
 * <P>
 * It is possible to request the use of a specific proxy through the
 * java properties
 * <CODE>https.proxyHost=</CODE><VAR>host</VAR> and
 * <CODE>https.proxyPort=</CODE><VAR>port</VAR>.
 * <P>
 * The authentication information required to configure the connector
 * is provided by the ConnectorAddress
 * parameter in the method {@link #connect connect}.
 *
 * @deprecated The JMX Remote API should be used in preference to the
 * legacy Java DMK connector classes.  This class may be removed in a
 * future version of Java DMK.  See {@link
