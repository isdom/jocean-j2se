/**
 * This interface specifies the methods for a connector to allow a listener to
 * receive notifications from a remote MBean in an agent.
 * <P>To forward a notification from the agent to the connector client, the user can configure the
 * connector to use either push or pull mode.
 * <UL><LI>In pull mode, the connector server on the agent side
 * buffers all notifications until the connector client requests,
 * or "pulls," them. The caller can configure the buffer cache size
 * and overflow behavior in the connector server. The caller can
 * also set the forwarding period to control how often
 * notifications are pulled from the connector server.</LI>
  
 * <LI>In push mode, the connector server forwards each and every
 * notification to the connector client as it is received. In the
 * current implementation, the cache and forwarding period are not
 * used in push mode--notifications are forwarded immediately.</LI></UL>
 *
 * @deprecated The JMX Remote API should be used in preference to the
 * legacy Java DMK connectors.  This interface may be removed in a
 * future version of Java DMK.  See {@link
 * org.jocean.j2se.jdmk.comm.JdmkLegacyConnector}.
