/**
 * This class provides an implementation of the 
 * {@link org.jocean.j2se.jdmk.comm.RemoteMBeanServer RemoteMBeanServer}
 * interface based on the HTTP/TCP protocol.
 * <P>
 * Querying a Java Dynamic Management agent with this connector implies that an instance of
 * {@link org.jocean.j2se.jdmk.comm.HttpConnectorServer HttpConnectorServer}
 * is running on the remote Java Dynamic Management agent.
 * <P>
 * <strong>Note - </strong> Use the
 * {@link #connect connect}
 * method to identify the Java Dynamic Management agent with which the connector must communicate.
 * <P>
 * It is possible to request the use of a specific proxy through the java properties
 * <CODE>http.proxyHost=</CODE><VAR>host</VAR> and <CODE>http.proxyPort=</CODE><VAR>port</VAR>.
 * <P>
 * The authentication information required to configure the connector is provided by the ConnectorAddress
 * parameter in the method {@link #connect connect}.
 * <p>
 * By default, port 8081 is used to communicate with HTTP/TCP connector.
 *
 * @deprecated The JMX Remote API should be used in preference to the
 * legacy Java DMK connector classes.  This class may be removed in a
 * future version of Java DMK.  See {@link
 * org.jocean.j2se.jdmk.comm.JdmkLegacyConnector}.
